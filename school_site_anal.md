In this way, transfer students will be able to know the exact requirements for a case of transfer.

## Ease of Retrieving Information

This website is quite friendly and accommodates using a uniform resource locator. Some of the essential navigational elements of the webpage include:

- **Search Feature**: It uses the search bar to locate a specific program on the webpage or even search for admission information.
- **Under the Obvious Headers**: Information is well categorically positioned under prominent headers like "Degrees & Programs," "Admissions," and "Tuition & Financing," which makes searching simpler.

## Features to Change

Even though it has already proved to be a great success, here are a few areas where the website can be improved:

- **Interactive Program Finder**: A tool to let the student filter programs interactively by interests, career goals, and previous credits will improve the user experience. This will enable the transfer students to identify quickly the programs that will be in sync with their background and academic goals.
- **Live Chat Support**: The Addition of a live chat feature would provide instant support to prospective students having specific questions or need guidance on their application. Real-time support will satisfy users and save much time which students could have taken to search for that information.
- **Student Testimonials and Success Stories**: More of the student's testimonials and success stories shall be included which help the prospective students to obtain some insight into what the experience has been for any student or alumni. This can help them evaluate the quality of education and support services offered under APUS.
- **Improved GUI**:
Instead of a tree filtered degree plan finder, I personally would prefer components rendered and filtered via common svg type logos. Components would be data card type object. when opened an infinite scrollable page with a floating header that provides information, pictures, carreer information, real world application examples of knowledge etc.

## Conclusion

The APUS website is indeed a handy website for transfer students as it helps them bring awareness about its various programs and comprehensive application guidelines. It will benefit users with enhancements that include an interactive finder, live chat help, and more student testimonials.
